        <P id="paragraph"> Rumi, was a 13th-century Persian poet, faqih, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic
            originally from
            Greater Khorasan. Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Tajiks,
            Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central
            Asian Muslims, and the Muslims of South Asia have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past
            seven centuries.</P>
        <p>His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats.
            Rumi has been described as the "most popular poet" and the "best selling poet" in the United States. we
            dedicated our restaurant after
            Him,since when I was a kid my dad used to read his poem to us. On that time I decided to have either a
            library or restaurant named after him, because his poetry was very inspiring for me and I would spend my
            whole day as a teenager listening
            and reading his poems.</p>
